Welcome to the "Navigating SQL" repository! This project illustrates working with SQL in a Python environment. It was undertaken as part of my learning journey with ALX.
This repository contains a series of SQL scripts and Python code examples that demonstrate various SQL functionalities, from creating tables to writing complex queries that include Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to improve their SQL skills.
Key features include but not limited to:
  Creating and managing SQL tables,
  Writing basic to advanced SQL queries,
  Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs),
  Implementing subqueries,
  Integrating SQL with Python.
